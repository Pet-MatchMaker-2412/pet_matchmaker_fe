These dogs are extremely loyal, docile, and protective of family. Their size and tendency to be wary of strangers make early training and socialization essential. These dogs are happy to lounge or accompany you on your daily walk. Mastiffs are magnificent pets and they are quite literally a huge commitment, but with the right amount of space will be a joyful addition to your life!"
